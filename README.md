# Welcome to the Simpl Machine Test Application

- This app allows us to have a place to test our Simple Machine framework .

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm ci
```
and then

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Making Changes

If you wish to make changes to the demo application you can do so by editing the `index.jsx` file under the app->routes directory.
to create a new page for the application, simply add a new `.jsx` to the routes directory and now you can navigate to `localhost:3000/newroute`.
